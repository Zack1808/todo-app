## Description

A simple React base Todo app that allows the user to create a list of todos. The list is stored on [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage), so that the tasks and their completions status stays stored. The user is also able to remove a task if the task is no longer needed.

## Features

- Add task: adds a task to the list of tasks the user created
- Mark completed: allows the user to place a checkmark on the task he is done with
- Remove task: delete the taske that are no longer needed
- Stored list: most up2date list is stored on localStorage
